# G1OS
Our aim was to provide an effective and efficient Operating system.
We are developing an operating system that consists of a kernel with multiprocessing features to help improve the computing capacity, as well as the storage capacity of the System 
Cloud-based operating systems provide a more secure computing environment than traditional on-premise systems. Cloud providers often have teams of security experts and implement best practices for security measures to protect against cyber threats.
Cloud-based operating systems provide more flexibility and remote work capabilities, which are particularly relevant in today's world, where more and more people are working remotely. With cloud-based operating systems, users can access their desktop environments and files from anywhere with an internet connection, which allows for more collaboration and productivity.

*Objective:
To provide fast execution of system processes and programs. Establishes communication between computer hardware (i.e. CPU, disk memory) and user application.

*Hosting on Cloud
1. Login to AWS account
2. Choose EC2 and Launch Instance
3. Choose Linux based O.S from the available AMI
4. Choose Instance Type
5. Configure the Instance
6. Review and edit Storage settings
7. Add Tags
8. Configure Security and Launch
9. Connect to instance using SSH
10. Once connected, you can install any additional software and configure the system as needed

Performance Evaluation:
In evaluating the performance of our operating system, we have focused on the effectiveness of the monolithic kernel. We have tested the kernel in various controlled environments to determine its efficiency and reliability. Our team has also focused on addressing any errors that have been identified during the testing process.
Overall, our evaluation of the monolithic kernel in our operating system has demonstrated its critical importance to the system's overall performance. While there are challenges in detecting errors, our team is committed to improving this aspect of the kernel's functionality to ensure optimal performance of our operating system.
